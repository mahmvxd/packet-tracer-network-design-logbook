# Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design & Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a multi-network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was planned, configured, and tested to ensure full connectivity between devices across multiple routers and switches.

The implementation includes IPv4 subnetting, VLSM addressing design, static routing configuration, DHCP services, and CLI-based device configuration.

---

## Objectives
- Design a structured IP addressing scheme using VLSM
- Configure routers and switches using Cisco CLI
- Implement static routing between multiple networks
- Configure DHCP for automatic IP allocation
- Verify end-to-end connectivity between devices
- Demonstrate understanding of networking fundamentals and data representation

---

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated
- IPv4 Subnetting
- Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
- Static Routing
- DHCP Configuration
- Router & Switch Configuration (CLI)
- Network Troubleshooting
- Binary Conversion & Logical Systems

## Repository Structure
packet-tracer/ → Packet Tracer topology file (.pkt)
report/ → Technical report (PDF documentation)
screenshots/ → Network topology and configuration evidence

---

## How to View the Project
1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Open the `.pkt` file inside the `packet-tracer` folder
3. Refer to the PDF report for detailed configuration steps and addressing tables

---

## Project Outcome
The final topology successfully enabled communication between all configured networks. Static routes and DHCP services were verified through connectivity testing, ensuring proper packet forwarding and IP address allocation.
